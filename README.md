# React + Vite

=> I used React + Vite to create this project.
=> first:   we will create vite + react app using "npm create vite@latest <project_name>"  command
=> second after the app is created we will run the "npm install" command
=> Third: to run this project we will use the "npm run dev" command

In this project on the home page event name, start date & end date, event location, and Image uploading are mandatory fields

for this project, I have used NodeJS and ExpressJS for the backend for creating and getting all the events in the frontend and MongoDB as database

The link for the backend repository for this project is this =>   https://github.com/siddharthagar229/Event_app_backend

below are the screenshots for the created application
