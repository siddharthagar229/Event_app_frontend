# React + Vite
<br>
=> I used React + Vite to create this project.
<br>
=> fFirst:   we will create vite + react app using "npm create vite@latest <project_name>"  command.
  <br>
=> Second after the app is created we will run the "npm install" command.
    <br>
=> Third: to run this project we will use the "npm run dev" command.
  <br>

In this project on the home page event name, start date & end date, event location, and Image uploading are mandatory fields.
  <br>
For this project, I have used NodeJS and ExpressJS for the backend for creating and getting all the events in the frontend and MongoDB as a database.
  <br>
The link for the backend repository for this project is this =>   https://github.com/siddharthagar229/Event_app_backend
  <br>



  Note: On the home page, a small calendar displays the current month and date, but on the event list page, the date, time, day, and month show when the event starts.
  <br>

I also have deployed this site:
<br>
The link to backend deployment is =>   https://event-app-backend-qvjh.onrender.com                   &nbsp; &nbsp; // First open this link then the frontend part link
<br>
The ink to the frontend deployment is =>   https://my-fornttt.onrender.com/
<br>

For navigation =>
<br>
=> To navigate from the home page to the list of events page, click the "Events" button in the Header.
<br>
=> To navigate from the list of events page to the home page, click "Looking to create more exciting events!".
